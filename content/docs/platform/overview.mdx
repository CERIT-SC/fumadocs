title: Welcome to the CERIT-SC Kubernetes Container Platform
---

Discover the power and flexibility of our cutting-edge container platform, built on the robust [Kubernetes orchestrator](https://kubernetes.io/) and utilizing [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) container images. Our platform leverages the Rancher Kubernetes distribution, providing an intuitive user interface through the [Rancher dashboard](https://rancher.cloud.e-infra.cz).

### Platform Highlights

* Architecture: Built on Linux and x86_64 architecture, with support for NVIDIA GPU accelerators and high-speed SSD storage.
* Networking: Experience seamless connectivity with InfiniBand 100Gbps and 200Gbps interconnect networks between selected nodes.
* Versatility: From simple web applications to complex workflow pipelines, our platform supports a wide range of use cases. Explore examples like the [hello world](../examples/helloworld) example, the Ansys remote desktop [ansys](../rancher-apps/ansys), and the [nextflow](../workflows/nextflow) workflow pipeline.

### User-Centric Design

Our platform empowers users to concentrate on their applications, minimizing the need for infrastructure knowledge. Whether you're using pre-built applications or creating your own Docker images - see [dockerfile](../docker/dockerfile) section), our platform simplifies the process. 


### Access and Eligibility
Access to our platform requires an academic affiliation or a sponsored account. Users can log in via e-INFRA CZ AAI (MetaCenter account), Elixir AAI, or EGI AAI, with no additional membership needed for standard projects with limited resources.

### Getting Started

   * Pre-Built Applications: Easily deploy applications through our infrastructure. Check out [Rancher Applications](../rancher-applications/overview) or Web Applications as Jupyter Notebook, Alphafold/Foldify,... in the navigation left menu.
   * Docker Image Utilization: Leverage a vast array of Docker images from global registries like [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com), keeping in mind any limitations.
   * Custom Application Development: Advanced users can create and deploy custom applications. Refer to the [dockerfile](../docker/dockerfile) section for guidance.
